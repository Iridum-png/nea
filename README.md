# Nea

This is the github repository containing all the code used in the production of my A Level Computer Science NEA project. Other small files unrelated to the final project may exist elsewhere.

This project is based around creating a web-based chess AI, inspired by that of Stockfish on lichess

The frontend of the site is a react app. The backend involves SQL, python, and rust.
